2. Description of the Data and Source
Dataset Name: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
Description: This dataset contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, 
including features such as age, sex, ticket class, and whether or not the individual survived.
The dataset is commonly used for binary classification problems and predictive modeling.
Source URL: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

df = pd.read_csv("titanic.csv")  # assuming the file is in your working directory
df.head()

#Checking for missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())

#Basic Statistics
print(df.describe(include='all'))#Quantitative + Categorical Variables
                           
 
# Dimensions of the DataFrame
df.shape
(891, 12)

#Variable Description & Types
df.dtypes

#Convert Pclass (which is currently int64) into string type
df['Pclass'] = df['Pclass'].astype(str)

#Before:
#Pclass    int64
#After:
#Pclass    object  # (because string type is stored as object in pandas)"""
#Convert Categorical to Numerical Variables (3 Methods)

#1.Label Encoding (Sex)
df['Sex_encoded'] = df['Sex'].map({'male': 0, 'female': 1})
#To print the newly created Sex_encoded column in your DataFrame after encoding, you can use:

print(df['Sex_encoded'])


#Or, to view it alongside the original Sex column for comparison:

print(df[['Sex', 'Sex_encoded']])
      
[891 rows x 2 columns]
#b. One-Hot Encoding (Embarked)
df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['Embarked'], drop_first=True)
print(df.head())
      
So, if:
both are 0(False) → Embarked was C

only Embarked_S = 1(True) → Embarked was S

only Embarked_Q = 1(True) → Embarked was Q
